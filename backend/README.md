# Restaurant Backend API

A standalone Restaurant reservation backend — Firebase phone-auth customers, Razorpay
booking-advance payments, Restaurant/Menu management, same-day food orders with an arrival time, and Admin/SuperAdmin
management APIs. Built with Node.js + Express 5 + TypeScript + Prisma 7 + MySQL/MariaDB.

This backend was transformed from a Hotel/PMS template. It has **no dependency on
GoAdapter, hotel/property/room domain models, or any hotel partner APIs** — it owns its
own authentication, database, and business logic end to end.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js 22, Express 5, TypeScript
- Prisma 7 + MySQL/MariaDB (via `@prisma/adapter-mariadb`)
- Redis 6.2+, BullMQ (booking reminder jobs), Socket.IO (Redis adapter)
- Firebase Admin SDK — verifies customer phone-auth ID tokens server-side
- Razorpay — booking advance payment (order + signature verification)
- OneSignal REST API — customer push notifications
- Zod validation, Pino logging

## Domain Model

`RestaurantUser` (customer, Firebase-authenticated) · `AdminUser` (ADMIN/SUPERADMIN,
scoped to restaurants via `AdminRestaurant`) · `Restaurant` · `RestaurantCategory` /
`RestaurantCategoryLink` (admin-manageable taxonomy, e.g. `pure_veg`, `north_indian`) ·
`MenuCategory` → `MenuItem` · `RestaurantBooking` (snapshots restaurant name/image/rating/cuisine/
distance at booking time so history renders correctly even if the restaurant changes
later) · `Payment` (Razorpay order/signature verification, independent of whether a
booking is ever created from it) · `RefreshSession` (rotating customer refresh tokens) ·
`Notification`.

## Authentication

**Customer** — Firebase Phone OTP on the client → `POST /api/auth/authenticate/` with
the Firebase ID token. The backend verifies the token server-side via Firebase Admin
(`firebase-admin/auth`), extracting the trusted UID + phone number — the client's
`firebase_token` is the only identity input trusted; a client can never assert its own
phone number, uid, id, or role. A `RestaurantUser` is created or updated (name/email/
`player_id`) and short-lived (`CUSTOMER_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL`, default 15m) access + rotating
refresh tokens are issued. Refresh tokens are opaque random values, stored only as a
SHA-256 hash in `RefreshSession`, and rotate on every `/api/auth/refresh/` call; reuse of
an already-rotated token revokes every active session for that user (theft detection).
`POST /api/auth/logout/` revokes the current refresh session.

**Admin / SuperAdmin** — classic email + bcrypt password login at
`POST /api/admin/auth/login`, issuing a JWT signed with a **separate secret**
(`JWT_SECRET`) from the customer token secret (`CUSTOMER_JWT_SECRET`) — an admin token
and a customer token can never be swapped between APIs even if someone tried, because
each middleware can only verify tokens signed with its own secret. SuperAdmin manages
everything; a plain Admin is scoped to specific restaurants via the `AdminRestaurant`
join table, enforced by `requireRestaurantAccess()` middleware on every restaurant-scoped
admin route.

## API Endpoints

GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE  /api/admin/restaurants/[:id]      [SuperAdmin: all; Admin: assigned only]
PATCH  /api/admin/restaurants/:id/rating                 [SuperAdmin only]
GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE  /api/admin/restaurants/:id/menu/categories[/:categoryId]
POST/PATCH/DELETE       /api/admin/restaurants/:id/menu/categories/:categoryId/items[/:itemId]

POST                    /api/uploads/images                [admin auth] banner/gallery/menu images
```

All responses use `{ "status": boolean, "message": string, "data"?: ... }`. Every
`/api/*` route also requires the shared `x-client-key` header when `APP_CLIENT_KEY` is
configured (defense-in-depth in front of JWT auth, mirrors the original project's
convention).

## Payment & Booking Flow

`POST /payments/initiate/` creates a Razorpay order for a **server-decided** amount
(`RESTAURANT_BOOKING_ADVANCE_INR`, default ₹99) — the client cannot influence the amount.
`POST /payments/verify/` verifies the Razorpay HMAC-SHA256 signature server-side and
marks the `Payment` row `VERIFIED`; a signature mismatch marks it `FAILED` and a second
verify attempt on an already-verified/failed order is rejected. Only then does
`POST /restaurants/:id/bookings/` accept the booking — it re-validates the payment
belongs to the caller and hasn't already funded a different booking, checks the arrival
time against today's window, and inserts the order as `upcoming`. There is no capacity
limit — the restaurant controls load by acknowledging or rejecting orders.

## Reminders & Notifications

Booking confirm/modify/cancel notifications are created (and pushed via OneSignal, and
emitted over `restaurant:notification:new` on the customer's socket room) synchronously
within the request, and so is a push for every status change (acknowledged, preparing,
ready, completed, cancelled, rejected). Arrival reminders are scheduled as a **delayed BullMQ
job** (`BOOKING_REMINDER_MINUTES_BEFORE` before the arrival time; skipped if that moment has
already passed), rescheduled on modify and cancelled on cancel/reject/complete — not a
per-booking `setTimeout`, so reminders survive process restarts.

## Orders: Arrival Time, Status Flow, Cancellation

Rules live in `src/config/policy.ts`, `src/constants/bookingStatus.ts` and
`src/services/arrivalService.ts`, not scattered across controllers:

- **Same-day only, arrival time instead of slots**: the customer picks an arrival time for
  today. Earliest = now + the restaurant's `prepTimeMax` (rounded up to `arrivalStepMinutes`,
  15); latest = the restaurant's closing time (`opensAt`/`closesAt`, set in General settings).
  Booking creation (which always carries a verified payment) gets `paidBookingGraceMinutes`
  (5) extra, so a customer who paid right at the cutoff isn't charged without an order.
- **Status flow**: `upcoming` → `acknowledged` → `preparing` → `ready` → `completed`, one step at
  a time, moved by the restaurant (`POST /admin/bookings/:id/status`).
- **Cancel**: the customer can cancel while `upcoming` or `acknowledged` — not once the food is
  `preparing`. The restaurant can cancel any order that isn't completed.
- **Reject**: restaurant only, and only while the order is still `upcoming`.
- **Modify**: arrival time / party size can change only while `upcoming`.
- **Refund policy**: every cancellation or rejection marks the full amount paid as refundable
  (`decideRefund`). The refund itself is not sent to Razorpay automatically.

Every status change is a single conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE status IN (...)`, so a customer
cancelling while the restaurant starts preparing can never both succeed.

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example`. Notably:

- `JWT_SECRET` / `CUSTOMER_JWT_SECRET` — **must differ** (see Authentication above).
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`/`FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`/`FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` (or
  `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`) — required for `/auth/authenticate/` to work; without
  them the endpoint fails closed with a 500, it never falls back to trusting the client.
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`/`RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` — when unset, payment order creation and
  signature verification run in a **mock mode** (clearly logged) so the full flow stays
  testable end-to-end locally without live Razorpay credentials.
- `ONESIGNAL_APP_ID`/`ONESIGNAL_API_KEY` — when unset, pushes are logged and skipped
  rather than failing the request (same graceful-degradation pattern the original
  codebase used for Firebase Cloud Messaging).

## Running Locally

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env         # fill in DATABASE_URL at minimum; Firebase/Razorpay/OneSignal
                              # can stay blank for local testing (see mock-mode notes above)
npm install
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate        # applies prisma/migrations/20260822000000_init
npm run db:seed               # 2 restaurants, SuperAdmin, Admin, menu
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:4000
```

Requires a reachable MySQL/MariaDB server and Redis 6.2+ (`REDIS_URL`, default
`redis://127.0.0.1:6379`). `npm run create-admin` (env-driven `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL`/
`SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD`) is an alternative to seeding when you only need a SuperAdmin
without sample restaurant data.

Seeded logins (also printed by `npm run db:seed`):

- SuperAdmin: value of `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL`/`SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` (defaults to
  `admin@gmail.com` / `123123` if unset — **change these before any shared deployment**)
- Admin: `manager@restaurant.local` / `Manager@12345` (scoped to "Shree Shyam Restaurant")

## Testing

```bash
npm test          # vitest run — unit + mocked-Prisma integration tests, no live DB needed
npm run test:watch
```

Tests never touch a real database — Prisma is mocked (`tests/helpers/mockPrisma.ts`) so
the suite is hermetic and fast. Coverage includes: cross-audience token rejection (a
customer token can't be replayed on an admin route or vice versa), IDOR protection on
booking access, SuperAdmin-only route enforcement, refresh-token rotation and reuse
detection, arrival-window, order status flow, cancel/reject/refund logic, and Razorpay
signature/duplicate-verification handling.

## Example Requests

**Authenticate**
```http
POST /api/auth/authenticate/
{ "firebase_token": "<Firebase ID token>", "name": "Rahul Sharma", "player_id": "..." }
→ { "status": true, "message": "Login successful",
    "data": { "access_token": "...", "refresh_token": "...", "user": { ... } } }
```

**Create a booking** (after `/payments/initiate/` → checkout → `/payments/verify/`)
```http
POST /api/restaurants/:id/bookings/
Authorization: Bearer <customer access token>
{
  "date": "2026-08-25", "time": "12:00 PM", "people": 4,
  "tablePreference": "Window Seat", "fullName": "Rahul Sharma",
  "mobileNumber": "+919876543210",
  "payment": { "razorpay_order_id": "...", "razorpay_payment_id": "..." }
}
```

## Deployment

Unchanged from the original project's PM2/GitHub Actions setup
(`.github/workflows/backend-deploy.yml`): build → `prisma migrate deploy` → restart under
PM2. No GoAdapter callback/webhook configuration is needed anymore.
